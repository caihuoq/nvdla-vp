Starting log.

Test 1
Trying to create filters with an invalid number of filter ports.

Only one transaction should be logged.
  Transaction 0x93a24f8 returning:
    mHasChanged      = 1
    mService     (1) = 0 (NO_SERVICE)
    mTarget      (1) = 0

Test 2
Testing the ServiceFilter with 2 filter ports.


This should be followed by two transactions, one NO_SERVICE CT and one CONFIG_SERVICE CT.
