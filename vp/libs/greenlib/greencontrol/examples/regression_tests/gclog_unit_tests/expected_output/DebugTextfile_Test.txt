Debug text output used with GC_Logger.
Starting log.

User output: This should be the first line in DebugTextfile_Test.txt after the header.
This should be the second line, but without the "User output:" prefix.

Test 2
After this, there should be a single transaction.

  Transaction 0x93a83a0:
    mHasChanged      = 0
    mService     (1) = 0 (NO_SERVICE)
    mTarget      (1) = 0
    mCmd         (1) = 0 (Warning: API/Plugin doesn't implement command_if!)
    mAnyPointer  (1) = 0
    mAnyPointer2 (1) = 0
    mAnyUint     (1) = 0
    mSpecifier   (1) = 
    mValue       (1) = 
    mID          (1) = 0x93a1678 (Warning: API/Plugin doesn't implement command_if!)
    mMetaData    (1) = 
    mError       (1) = 0
    mLogPointer  (1) = 0
    mCmdIf       (1) = 0
    mLogConfig   (1) = 0x93a83e0 (hasChanged: 0)
    -> pNext     (0) = 0

Test 3
Now the same transaction should be printed, followed by another, which acts as a returning CT

  Transaction 0x93a83a0:
    mHasChanged      = 0
    mService     (1) = 0 (NO_SERVICE)
    mTarget      (1) = 0
    mCmd         (1) = 0 (Warning: API/Plugin doesn't implement command_if!)
    mAnyPointer  (1) = 0
    mAnyPointer2 (1) = 0
    mAnyUint     (1) = 0
    mSpecifier   (1) = 
    mValue       (1) = 
    mID          (1) = 0x93a1678 (Warning: API/Plugin doesn't implement command_if!)
    mMetaData    (1) = 
    mError       (1) = 0
    mLogPointer  (1) = 0
    mCmdIf       (1) = 0
    mLogConfig   (1) = 0x93a83e0 (hasChanged: 0)
    -> pNext     (0) = 0
  Transaction 0x93a8418 returning:
    mHasChanged      = 1
    mService     (1) = 2 (AV_SERVICE)
    mTarget      (1) = 0
    mCmd         (1) = 0 (Warning: API/Plugin doesn't implement command_if!)
    mAnyPointer  (1) = 0x93a1678
    mAnyPointer2 (1) = 0
    mAnyUint     (1) = 0
    mSpecifier   (1) = This transaction should be modified.
    mValue       (1) = 
    mID          (1) = 0x93a1678 (Warning: API/Plugin doesn't implement command_if!)
    mMetaData    (1) = This way it should act as a returning transaction
    mError       (1) = 0
    mLogPointer  (1) = 0
    mCmdIf       (1) = 0
    mLogConfig   (1) = 0x93a8458 (hasChanged: 1)
    -> pNext     (0) = 0

Test 4
Another LogConfig was activated. This should be visible in the following output.

  Transaction 0x93a83a0:
    mHasChanged      = 0
    mService     (0) = 0 (NO_SERVICE)
    mTarget      (0) = 0
    mCmd         (0) = 0 (Warning: API/Plugin doesn't implement command_if!)
    mAnyPointer  (1) = 0
    mAnyPointer2 (0) = 0
    mAnyUint     (0) = 0
    mSpecifier   (0) = 
    mValue       (0) = 
    mID          (0) = 0x93a1678 (Warning: API/Plugin doesn't implement command_if!)
    mMetaData    (0) = 
    mError       (0) = 0
    mLogPointer  (0) = 0
    mCmdIf       (0) = 0
    mLogConfig   (0) = 0xbfe8d8a4 (hasChanged: 1)
    -> pNext     (1) = 0x93a83e0 -> 0

Regular end of log.
