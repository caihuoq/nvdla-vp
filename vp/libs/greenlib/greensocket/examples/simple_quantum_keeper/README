This example shows how to use the GreenSocs quantum keeper to keep
track of the temporal decoupled time in each instant of the
simulation.

The gs_quantumkeeper class should be used both in the master and the
slave to be more precise.

To show how easy it is to change an existing module, we use the
original file ExplicitLTTarget.h from TLM2 distribuition with only 3
minor modifications to use the GreenSocs Quantum Keeper.

1) #include <greensocket/generic/gs_quantumkeeper.h>
2) change the name of myBTransport second argument from t to time_arg
3) declare a gs_quantumkeeper to replace the original sc_time t argument

A global temporal decoupled time is stored for each SystemC
process. The method gs_quantumkeeper::getTD() returns the time for the
current executing thread.

This example use the GreenAV output plugin TXT_TD_FILE_OUT, which is a
variation of the TXT_FILE_OUT that recognizes and outputs the temporal
decoupled time along with the current simulation time when printing
parameters.
